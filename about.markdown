## About me ##

I am a statistician who takes calculated risk and embraces the uncertainty from God. 

I am a vegan. I like cooking, drawing/painting, flute, running/yoga and traveling. I am addicted to analyzing data and reading. I know nothing about sport games.

## About this site ##
It is meant to be somewhere to dump my thoughts when my head gets messy and needs to sort things out.
