[Central Iowa R User Group](http://www.cirug.com) held a workshop given by Yihui Xie on the ecosystem of R Markdown,, July 14, 2015. I will give a quick tour here on R Markdown and the series of R packages Yihui talked about that can be used to generate reproducible and interactive reports.

### What is R Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to make authoring content easy for everyone. Rather than writing complex markup code (e.g. LyX, XML,  HTML or LaTeX), Markdown enables the use of a syntax much more like plain-text email.  It is young comparing to the other markup languages. What makes markdown distinct is that it is both machine-readble and human-readble.

R Markdown combines the core syntax of markdown and embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully _reproducible_ and the most important, it is _simple_!

### How to Start?

Please install R if you haven't. You can get R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org). After installing R, install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). Once you have RStudio, launch it. After that, I encourage those who are new to R Markdown start from this introductory article [R Markdown — Dynamic Documents for R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) which can get you started with R Markdown right away. Once you install R Markdown package and learn the most commonly used markdown constructs, you can go into more depth on customizing the behavior of embedded R code. The “Learning More” section on the bottom of the [introductory article](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) has a list of reference you can refer to learn more about R Markdown. 


### Interactive R Markdown Document
There are some packages that can be used to make interactive R Markdown documents. 

**DT: A Wrapper of the JavaScript Library 'DataTables'**

The R package **DT** provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables. R data objects (matrices or data frames) can be displayed as tables on HTML pages, and DataTables provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and many other features in the tables. Here is an example with zero configuration:

```
install.packages("DT")
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```
