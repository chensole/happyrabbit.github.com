Life in Iowa has taught me how to dance with snow. The world is not 
perfect since human nature is not perfect. However, I am truly grateful about my life. 
Different people came to me. Some left me soon; some I thought would stay but left me eventually;
Some have been staying ever since. I thank all who have come to me and taught me things. Keep happy everyone! : ) 

I used wordpress before and moved to Github since the previous server was hacked. 
Most of the old records were lost which is not a bad thing. This website layout is a fork of 
[Sreejith Kesavan](http://foobarnbaz.com/) with some minor modifications. I really like the clean and simple style. 
Thanks a lot Sreejith Kesavan!
