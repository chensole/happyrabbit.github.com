## About me ##

I am a [statistician](http://scientistcafe.com) who takes calculated risk and embraces the uncertainty from God. 

I am vegan. I like drawing/painting, flute, piano, running, yoga and cooking (I consider myself as a good cook but the problem is that I am the only one think so. The best comment I got from Mom on my cook is “just eatable”). I love traveling and joke/joking : ). I am addicted to [analyzing data](http://scientistcafe.com) and [reading](http://linhui.org/ReadingNotes).
