# Reading List

It is my reading list since 2009. The reading notes are arranged according to book category.There are tons of paper notes need to be electronized and I will keep working on it in my spare time (it will be very nice if Pioneer allows me to work on my reading notes during working hours......I am just dreaming.>_<) ......I know nothing about library science but the goal here is to make things more structurized and easy to search which will be especially helpful when I am travelling. Good luck......   

My personal comments will start with "Hui:". Sometimes I summarize the contents with my own words. It is great if you find any of those notes useful for you as well. I thank all my friends who recommended great books to me. If you have any questions or awesome books that you keenly want to share, feel free to email me at: longqiman@gmail.com. Thank you!

```{r,echo=FALSE}

```


- **Name**: Book name
- **ID**: Book index number 
- **Category**: Book category  
- **Author**: Author of the book
- **Progress**: My reading progress(from 0% [haven't started] to 100% [finished])
- **Priority**: My reading priority

## Basic Statistical Analysis

Here is a plot for counts of books in each category......Obviously, my favourite is "Philosophy and Psychology" and I am not very interested in "Politics"......

```{r, echo=FALSE}
booktb<-data.frame(table(dat$Category))
names(booktb)<-c("Category","Counts")
booktb<-booktb[order(booktb$Counts,decreasing = T),]
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(booktb, aes(x=reorder(Category,Counts), y=Counts, fill=Category)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+ coord_flip()+ ylab("Counts") + xlab("Category")+ theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here is a plot showing the percentage of books I have started (or finished) for each category.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Progress<-rep("Started",nrow(dat))
idx<-which(dat$Progress=="")
Progress[idx]<-"Not-Started"
dat$Status<-Progress
ggplot(dat, aes(Category,fill=Status)) +
geom_bar(position="fill")+ coord_flip()+ ylab("Percentage") + xlab("Category")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Philosophy

## The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying [西藏生死书，Sogal Rinpoche]

> Hui: 这本书让你严肃系统的思考死亡，从藏传佛教的角度讲述生死。结合了中西方思想，时而引入基督教的例子。虽然对许多地方有疑问，但还是非常推荐这本书。看过之后或许能向不畏死，亦能好好活跨进一步。

### Living [生]

Karma: 业力  
Phowa: 颇瓦法  
Samsara: 轮回世界
Rigpa: 本觉
Nangpa: 佛教徒，内省的人

#### In the Mirror of Death [在死亡的镜子中]

- The disastrous effects of the denial of death go far beyond the individual: They affect the whole planet. Believing fundamentally that this life is the only one, modern people have developed no long-term vision. So there is nothing to restrain them from plundering the planet for their own immediate ends and from living in a selfish way that could prove fatal for the future. （否定死亡的可怕影响力，绝不止于个人层面，它影响着整个地球。由于大多数人相信人生就只有这么一世，现代人已经丧失长远的眼光。因此，他们肆无忌惮地为着自己眼前的利益而掠夺地球。）

#### Impermanence [无常]

- To practice death is to practice freedom. A man who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave. [Montaigne]
- Death is a vast mystery, but there are two things we can say about it: (1) It is absolutely certain that we will die; (2) It is uncertain when or how we will die.
- Why do we live in such terror of death? Because our instinctive desire is to live and to go on living, and death is a savage end to everything we hold familiar.
- Perhaps the deepest reason why we are afraid of death is because we do not know who we are.
- Without our familiar props, we are faced with just ourselves, **a person we do not know, an unnerving stranger with whom we have been living all the time but we never really want to meet**.

> Hui: 我们被各种各样的刺激、快感催眠(hypnotize)，生活渐渐沦为手段淹没目的的过程。不知道自己是谁，不知道为什么活着。

- Just look at your mind for a few minutes. You will see that it is like a flea, constantly hopping to and fro. 
- The birth of a man is the birth of his sorrow. The longer he lives, the more stupid he becomes, because his anxiety to avoid unavoidable death becomes more and more acute. What bitterness! He lives for what is always out of reach! His thirst for survival in the future makes him incapable of living in the present. (人之生也，与忧俱生。寿者昏昏，久忧不死。何苦也！其为形也，亦远矣！《庄子至乐篇》)
- Our lives are monotonous, petty, and repetitive, wasted in the pursuit of the trivial, because we seem to know of nothing better.....The pace of our lives is so hectic that the last thing we have time to think of is death. 
- As a Tibetan saying goes:"Tomorrow or the next life, which comes first, we never know."
- Discipline is to do what is appropriate or just; that is, in an excessively complicated age, to simplify our lives......the only serious goals in life are **"learning to love other people and acquiring knowledge(学习爱别人和获得知识)"**......**Whatever we have done with our lives makes us what we are when we die.(我们一生的所作所为，造就了我们去世时的模样。)** And everything, **absolutely everything counts**.
- In our minds changes always equal loss and suffering. And if they come, we try to anesthetize ourselves as far as possible. We assume that permanence provides security and impermanence does not. (我们害怕变化)
- The past is past, the future not yet risen, and even the present thought, as we experience it, becomes tha past. The only thing we really have is now......Has my understanding of death and impermanence become so keen and so urgent that I am devoting every second to the pursuit of enlighternment?

#### Reflection and Changes [反省与改变]

- There is one way, and one way only, out of samsara's ceaseless round of brith and death, which is the path to liberation.
- Those with dualistic perception（分别心） regard suffering as happiness, like they who lick the honey from a razor edge.
- We may idealize freedom, but when it comes to our habits, we are completely enslaved.
- Learning to live is learning to let go.
- There is nothing wrong with the desire to be happy, but what we grasp on to is by nature ungraspable. The Tibetans say you cannot wash the same dirty hand twice in the same running river, and, "No matter how much you squeeze a handful of sand, you will never get oil out of it."
- How can we work to overcome attachment? Only by realizing its impermanent nature; this realization slowly releases us from its grip. 

> Hui: understand and accept uncertainty. being mortal

- Nothing has any **inherent** existence of its own when you really look at it, and this absence of independent existence is what we call "emptiness".

> Hui: It reminds me the beginning of Ecclesiastes.   
**[Ecclesiastes 1:2-10]** "Everything is meaningless", says the Teacher, "completely meaningless!" What do people get for all their hard work under the sun? Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes. The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again. The wind blows sounth, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles. Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content. History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new. Sometimes people say, "Here is something new!" But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new.

- Always recognize the dreamlike qualities of life and reduce attachment and aversion. (认知生命有如梦幻，减少执著和嗔怨)

> Hui: 无所不有是**全**，一无所有是**空**。全是面子，空是里子。什么都是也就无所谓是什么，等于什么都不是，意识到这一点，就可以放下了。

#### The Nature of Mind[心性]
- "the homage of the View" It is a devotion that springs spontaneously from seeing the View of the nature of mind.(“知见皈依”这是从看到心性的知见而当下产生的恭敬心。)
- **Life and death are in the mind, and nowhere else.**

> Hui: It resonates what Bible says. Jesus came to show us the way, teach us the truth and invite us to find life. As Jesus said to the Samaritan woman:"Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again. But those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again. It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them eternal life." Indeed, life and death depend on your mind, your faith. 

- There are many aspects to the mind, but two stand out.   
     1. Ordinary mind, called by the Tibetans _sem_. One master defines it:"That which possesses discriminating awareness, that which possesses a sense of duality--which grasps or rejects something external--that is mind. Fundamentally it is that which can associate with an 'other'--with any 'something', that is perceived as different from the perceiver."(凡夫心，分别，相对心)
     1. Then there is the very nature of mind, its innermost essence, which is absolutely and always untouched by change or death. At present it is hidden within our own mind, our _sem_, enveloped and obscured by the mental scurry of our thoughts and emotions.(本性，心的底蕴，不受凡夫心影响。)
- The nature of mind is the very root itself of understanding. In Tibetan we call it _Rigpa_, a primordial, pure, pristine awareness that is at once intelligent, cognizant, radiant, and always awake. It could be said to be the knowledge of knowledge itself. (心性是了解的基础。)
- When a much larger number of people know the nature of their minds, they'll know also the glorious nature of the world they are in, and struggle urgently and bravely to preserve it. It's interesting that the word for "Buddhist" in Tibetan is _nangpa_. It means "insider-er": someone who seeks the truth not outside, but within the nature of mind.
- The central truth of Buddha's teaching: that we are all already essentially perfect.

> Hui: I don't agree that we are already essentially perfect.

#### Bringing the Mind Home [把心带回家]
- In fact, we are already perfectly trained by and for samsara, trained to get jealous, trained to grasp, trained to be anxious and sad and desperate and greedy, trained to react angrily to whatever provikes us. We are trained, in fact, to such an extent that these negative emotions rise spontaneously, without our even trying to generate them. 

## Gravity and Grace [重负与神恩, Simone Weil] 


> Hui: 这是我在2012年读的一本书，书很薄但很实，没有废话。Weil认为，不幸是绝对的。人的存在的不幸是无法消除的。她尖锐的地指出任何社会形态——哪怕是最近完美的社会形态都不能消除人的不幸，不幸不同于不义，所以革命不能代替人的救赎，而只能掩盖不幸，忽略看轻人的不幸，这也就是柏拉图所谓的猛兽式的社会性残忍。“爱是一种神圣的东西。若深入内心，就会将它撕裂。人心被创造出来就是供撕裂的。当它被其它东西撕裂时，就是最可悲的浪费。但它宁可被其它东西撕裂而不是被神圣的爱。因为神圣的爱只撕裂自愿被撕裂的心。这种自愿是困难的。”从一个基督徒的角度，我对这句话的理解是我们只有摒弃过去的自己（也就是所谓的撕裂），将自己交给神，相信神，才能得到永恒的神恩。神恩的翻译是Grace，我及其喜欢这个关于Grace的定义： “Grace is God's kindness, his love, his care, his work on our behalf, his blessings, his gifts, his goodness, his forgiveness, and his salvation. But it is more than that--it is all these things **when they are undeserved**, when they are **pure gift**”.   只有来自神恩的爱才能够改变我们，改变接受神恩的人，也改变了这些接受神恩后向其他人传递神恩的人。为什么放弃原来那个自己那么困难？因为骄傲，我们放不下内心的骄傲，便无法接受神的恩典。这种放下和自愿被撕裂当然是困难的，否则神恩来的太便宜了。    
此外，作者认为包含真理的思想存在于不同的宗教经典，文学与科学著作中，真理遵循不同的途径显示在人们的精神中。比如希腊几何学和诗歌，中国的道教，埃及的俄赛里斯教，印度佛经等，都融合了圣经所包含的真理。

- 两种力量主宰着宇宙：光(light)和重力(gravity)。重负，一般地说，人们期待他人的事是我们身上的重负效果决定的；人们从他人那里得到的由他人身上重负效果所决定。**为何一旦有人表示有一点，或非常需要别人时，别人会选择远离？重负所致。** 灵魂的一切自然的运动受物质万有引力一类的规律制约。唯有神恩例外。

> Hui: 神的爱是无条件的。

- 在这种情况下，我至少由有好几次忍不住说出伤人之语。向重负屈服了。这是大逆不道。话语的功能就是如此被滥用，话语是用来表达事物关系的。
- 伤害他人，就是要从中得到什么。得到什么呢？当伤害他人时，赢得了什么？人们扩展了自己。发展了自己。在他人身上建立虚无以填平自身的虚无。
- 若想到上帝不存在而爱上帝，他将会显示他的存在。

> Hui: 我们对上帝的爱也需要是无条件的。

- 一切虚空，（不被接受）产生仇恨、刻薄、苦涩、积怨。人们盼望自己所恨的遭到恶报，以及人们想象的饿恶重建起了平衡。
- 创造是一种矮的行为，它是永久的。我们存在的每时每刻都是上帝对我们的爱。但上帝只能爱自己。他对我们的爱是通过我们去爱他自己。因此，是他赋予我们存在，他爱我们而甘愿不存在。......我们的存在只是由于他的期待，由于我们不同意不存在造成的他永久地向我们乞求他赋予我们的这个存在。他把存在给予我们是为了向我们乞求它。......正是上帝出自爱而离开我们，以便我们能爱他。因为倘若我们直接沐浴在他的爱的辉映下而没有空间、时间和物质的掩护，我们就会像阳光中的水一样蒸发掉；我们就不会有足够的我可以为了爱而放弃那个“我”。
- 只要我们尚未明白我们有底，我们便是无底的桶。......我们只拥有自己弃绝的东西。人们失去了自己不愿意弃绝的东西。在此意义上，不经由上帝，人们便不能拥有任何东西。
- 上帝并不仅只有一次使自己成为血肉，他每天都使自己成为物以共给人，供人食用。反之亦然，人由于劳累，不幸和死亡而成为物，并被上帝食用。怎么能拒绝这种相互性？
- 因为不幸的伤口和不幸所引起的屈辱使人认识人间疾苦，这种认识乃是一切智慧之门。
- 人的生命中只有两个完美的赤裸和纯洁的时刻：出生和死亡。
- 在没有我们的情况下创造了我们的人并不会在没有我们的情况下拯救我们——Saint Augustine  
幕，就是人的苦难：甚至对于基督也有帷幕。......扎根于漂泊不定之中。
- 我身上具有的精力，天赋等等，又有何用？我受够了，可以消失了。......当我在某处时，我的呼吸，我的心跳，会玷污天上和地下的宁静。
- 必然的两面：行使必然和承受必然。阳光(sunshine)和十字架(cross)。......服从必然而非服从束缚。......行为是天平的指针。不应触碰指针，而是触碰砝码。......惟有完全的超脱才能使人透过骗人的价值的迷雾看到赤裸的事物。

> Hui: 如何完全超脱呢？

- 我们接受在我们面前显现的虚假的价值，当我们认为在行动时，实际上我们静止未动，因为我们依然处在同样的价值体系中。......有关尘世事物的错觉并不涉及其存在，而是其价值。
- 我们身上源于撒旦的东西便是想象。

> Hui: I don't understand it.

- 期限，对于文明来说是以世纪计数，对于个人来说是以年，数十年计数，它具有一种不适者消亡的达尔文式的功能。
- 在屈辱中，傲慢使内在的谎言越来越大。......所有无价值的东西都逃避光照。在尘世，人可以借肉体隐藏自身。死后就办不到了。人就赤裸裸地把自己交付给光照。

> Hui: 和西藏生死书里的观点类似。

- 人们不可能面对面见到上帝而不死，但人们并不愿死。......肉体并非是使我们远离上帝的东西，它是我们遮在面前的帷幕以在我们和上帝之间制造屏障。

> Hui: 人一边说爱着上帝，要追随上帝，一边却又紧紧抓住尘世的光阴。我至今也不明白为什么。或许在活着的时候就是为了要努力的修行，使我们能够在死时见到上帝而不逃离，抓住那光明，并且于光明同在。所以我们在准备，一直在准备，我们抓住尘世，是因为觉得自己还没有准备好。

- 渴望躲避孤独是一种胆怯行为。......模仿上帝是一种不良企图。
- 恶，当人们身处恶中时它并不被感知为恶，而是被感知为必然性或者责任。


# Psychology

## The Theory of Moral Sentiments [Adam Smith]
### Of the Propriety of Action
#### Of the Sense of Propriety
##### Of Sympathy
1. Principles in the nature, the emotion which we feel for the misery of others when we either see it, or are made to conveive it in a very lively manner. (人性中的原始感情)
1. 原因：看到引发那种感情的处境
1. 恐惧死亡：对死者同情。我们把自己还活着的灵魂塞进他们已失去活力的躯壳里，然后设想在这种情况下我们自己将会有什么样的情绪。正是该错觉，在我们死后无疑不可能给我们带来任何痛苦的那些情况，在我们活着时想起来却让我们心痛不已。

##### Of the Pleasure of Mutual Sympathy [论彼此同情的快感]
1. 最让我们愉快的事，显然莫过于发现他人的感觉和我们自己心理全部情绪一致；而最让我们震惊的，也莫过于发现他人和我们完全没有同感......同情感活化喜悦，缓和悲伤......我们更加渴望向朋友倾诉我们心理的不愉快；他们同情我们的不愉快，比同情我们的喜悦， 会让我们得到更大的满足，而他们对我们的不愉快缺乏同情感，则比他们对我们的喜悦缺乏同情感，更加另我们震惊。

## People of the lie [M Scott Peck]

### Introduction: Handle with care

- Remember Saint Augustine's advice to hate the sin but love the sinner. [憎恨罪恶，但要爱有罪的人]
- Great evil has been committed throughout the centuries--and is still committed--by nominal Christians, often in the name of Christ.
- There are hundreds of thousands who go to Christian churches every Sunday who are not the least bit willing to be displeasing to themselves, serenely or otherwise, and who are not, therefore, for Jesus a pleasant place of shelter. Conversely, there are millions of Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, atheists and agnostics who are willing to bear that trial. 

### The man who made a pact with the devil
- obsessive-compulsive neurosis （强迫妄想型精神官能症）
- the pattern of unwanted thoughts and the taking of undesired actions

### Toward A Psychology of Evil

- While some seek in religion an escape from mystery, for others religion is a way to approach mystery. The latter are not loath to employ the **reductionistic（还原论，简化论）** methods of science, but they are also not reluctant to use more integrative "right brain" means of exploration: meditation, intuition, feeling, faith, and revelation. For them bigger the mystery, the better.
- The problem of evil can hardly be separated from the problem of goodness. Were there no goodness in the world, we would not even be considering the problem of evil.
- It is as if we automatically assume this is a naturally good world that has somehow been contaminated by evil......If we seriously think about it, it probably makes more sense to assume this is a naturally evil world that has somehow been mysteriously "contaminated" by goodness, rather than the other way around. The mystery of goodness is even greater than the mystery of evil.
- Thus we may "break" a horse or even a child without harming a hair on its head. Erich Fromm was acutely sensitive to this fact when he broadened the definition of **necrophilia （恋尸癖）**to include the desire of certain people to control others-----to make them controllable, to foster their dependency, to discourage their capacity to think for themselves, to diminish their unpredictability and originality, to keep them in line. Distinguishing it from a **"biophilic" person（具有生物自卫本能的人）**, one who appreciates and fosters the variety of life forms and the uniqueness of the individual, he demonstrated a "necrophilic character type" whose aim is to avoid the inconvenience of life by transforming others into obedient automatons, robbing them of their humanity.....Evil is that force, residing either inside or outside of human beings, that seeks to kill life or liveliness. Goodness is that which promotes life and liveliness.（弗洛姆广义的界定“恋尸癖”时，增列了某些人对他人的控制欲：使他人受控制，增强依赖度，削弱其主动性，接受管束。弗洛姆将“恋尸癖性格的人”和“具有生物自卫本能的人”加以区分：前者将他人改变为顺从的机器人，剥夺他们的人性，借以回避人生的艰难；而后者则承认并鼓励生命的多样变化，以及“人”独有的特性。）
- A psychology of evil must be a religious psychology......it must not only embrace valid insights from all religious traditions but must also recognize the reality of the "supernatural".
- Having fled the **Jewish persecution** of the Hitler regime, the psychoanalyst **Erich Fromm** spent much of the rest of his life sutdying the evil of **Naziism**. He （_原书中讲他是第一个也是唯一一个确定邪恶人格类型的科学家，此书写与1983年，这个说法已经不正确了_）.......to identify an evil personality type, to attempt to examine evil people in depth, and to suggest that they be studied still further.
- The great Jewish theologian **Martin Buber** distinguished between two types of myths about evil. One type conerns people in the process of "sliding" into evil. The other concerns those who have already slid, "fallen victim" to and been taken over by "radical" evil.

## Psychobabble [Stephen Briers]

## Art of Thinking Clearly [Rolf Dobelli,清醒思考的艺术]
1. 幸存偏差：由于日常生活中更容易看到成功而非失败，使得人们高估成功的希望（创业）
1. 游泳选手的身材错觉：混淆选择标准与结果（模特因为漂亮才选来拍化妆品广告，而非因为用了这些产品才漂亮）
1. 过度自信效应：1）不存在不够自信效应；2）男性更加严重；3）悲观者只是高估幅度少些。
1. 从众心理
1. 纠缠沉没成本：all pay auction的困局
1. 互惠偏误：互惠古来有之，是出色的生存智慧。没有互惠人类早灭绝了。但注意不要被互惠道德绑架。
1. 确认偏误：所有思维错误之父......过滤与我们观点相矛盾的信息。宗教和哲学信念是杰出的例子。
1. 权威偏误：对权威批判性越强，你就越自由。
1. 对比效应/框架效应/锚定效应：这几个都类似
1. 现成偏误：依据现成的例子来想象世界。某种东西反复出现我们的大脑就很容易重新提取（接受）它，尽管不一定是真的。
1. 事后诸葛亮(Hindsight Bias)
1. 司机的知识：播音员是话筒不是专家。芒格认为知识有两种：1）真知识，来自那些投入大量时间和思考获得知识的人们；2）司机的知识，装的好像知道的人，他们会模仿别人的表演，也可能有动听的声音或具有说服力的形象。但他们传播的知识是空洞的，他们高谈阔论地挥霍华丽词汇。企业越大，人们越期望它的CEO具有表演才能——交际能力。
1. 控制错觉：你对你生活的控制比你以为的要少。(电梯上的安慰按钮。公司温度控制的按钮。)


## Thinking Fast and Slow [Daniel Kahneman]
## Predictable Irrational

### Goal: what makes you and people around you tick?

behavior economics, judgment and decision making (JDM)
Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARF)

We are irrational
Our irrationality is predictable

- The fallacy of supply and demand
James Assael, Salvador Assael (peark king, James' son), black pearl from black-lipped oysters, put them in the window of Harry Winston's store on Fifth Avenue, Tahitian black pearls glowed

> Mark Twain in Tom Sawyer: "Tom had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain."

Anchor effect: last two digits of social security number, how much would you pay for the product?

Assael anchored his pearls to the finest gems in the world and the prices followed forever

# Society and Culture  

## Much Depends on Dinner [Margaret Visser]

### Introduction
- We prefer, as De Quincey's essay says, "to throw the grace of intellectual enjoyment over an animal necessity." （正如De Quincey在文章中说的，我们喜欢“用优雅的精神享受来掩盖动物性的需要”。）
- Again, we should be aware that our meal is almost totally **female in connotation**. _Corn_ is the American Indian "mother and nourisher"; _chicken_ (pale meat, no red blood, and little fat in evidence) is for us a typically "female" choice; _rice_, a delicate grain-----especially when it is "fluffy", as we like it-----white like chichen, and in its **mythical origins** a girl-child; _lettuce_ is light and unfattening, but also cold, milky, and female; _lemons_ nippled, _olive oil_ virgin, _ice cream_ cold milky, and served in definitely womanly, rounded shapes; _salt_ is the on exception, but even it is neuter and not masculine; _butter_ from cream is again female.

### Corn
- 玉米片(Corn Flakes)
凯洛格所用的**“谷物回火”**方法在**1894**年取得专利。(The **Kellogg** "grain-tempering" process was patented in 1894.)
－ 玉米和遗传学(Corn and Genetics)
在美洲殖民地无所不在的玉米，除了食用之外又发展出上千种用途，其中一个用途就是用玉米穗轴制成的烟斗。(The ubiquity of the corn plant in **Colonial America** had made it standard material for a thousand uses which had nothing to do with food. One devive was the corncob smoking pipe.)
- 玉米植株兼具雄性（穗）与雌性（须）两种性别，杂交玉米通过摘除自身的穗来完成，这样以来，玉米植株就不会自身授粉，而是必须接受来自其它植株的花粉。......通过受制遗传，培育出雄花不育的植株。(A corn plant is both male (its tassels) and female (its silks). Hybrid corn seed is to bear the grain, so that the plant cannot seed itself but will receive pollen from the other inbred parent chosen to be planted in the same field......by genetic manipulation, to produce no pollen.)
- 同一性是一个现代社会特有的诅咒，它伪装着自己，以多样化的形式装在超市的罐头里，盒子里，瓶子里和纸板箱中。每一件摆在架子上的东西里都含有玉米，因此我们依赖着玉米，玉米也依赖着我们。我们自己证明出来的无能为力，却让我们承担起越来越多不可逃避的责任。(Uniformity, disguise itself as it may behind the multiplicity of cans, boxes, bottles, and cartons in our supermarkets, is a peculiarly modern curse. Everything on the shelves contains corn. We therefore depend on corn. But corn depends increasingly, because of our wanton（荒唐的） wastefulness, on us. Our own demonstrations of our incapacity to manage have placed us more exclusively and inescapably in charge.)

### Salt

- 盐税，中国从公元前7世纪开始由政府垄断了盐。(China had a salt monopoly from the 7th century BC. Salt was also one of the first commodities to be taxed. "The art of taxation consists of plucking the goose so as to obtain the most feathers with the least hissing.)
- 1825年，经过了400年的怨恨与诅咒，英国废除了盐税，是第一个废除盐税的国家。(In 1825, after four hundred years of resentment, England abolished her salt tax. She was the first country to do so.)
- 为夺回印度的盐并在不加税的情况下进行买卖，印度人民的非暴力不合作运动开始了。(Non-violent activities undertook to get India's salt and sell it free of tax.) 
- 盐，明亮，干燥，愉快，强悍，在许多种语言中，都是聪明与睿智的同义词。(Salt, brignt, dry, titillating, and dynamic, is synonymous in several languages with wit and wisdom.)

### Ice-cream
- 至少在1100BC，中国人就知道如何在地下建造冰库。

> Hui: 有种说法是，唐朝的《酉阳杂俎（yǒu yáng zá zǔ）》[是笔记小说集]里头，已经提到过冰与奶制品混一的玩意，叫做“酪饮”。宋朝时，大家也习惯类似东西叫冰酪，可能那就是冰淇淋的雏形。但法国人相信，冰淇淋是美第奇嫁到法国之后，才真正进入文明世界的——那就天晓得了。[“美第奇家族”（Medici Family）是佛罗伦萨13世纪至17世纪时期在欧洲拥有强大势力的名门望族。Maria de' Medici于1600年嫁给亨利四世，成为其第二任妻子，法国王后，路易十三的母亲。她是意大利豪门美第奇家族的重要成员。]

- 第一个影响深远并且享有声望(influential and lasting fame)的咖啡馆(Cafe)，是巴黎的Cafe Procope。Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli在1686年开办了这座咖啡馆，他是意大利人(Italian)，可能经由弗洛伦萨(Florence)从西西里岛(Sicily)而来。
- The first automatic cane-rolling machine（蛋筒制造机）was invented in 1909.
- 1932年，冰激凌工业进入岛一个全新的阶段(entirely new phase)，这是Clarence W. Vogt 发明了连续冰激凌冷冻制造机(continuous ice-cream freezer)。

### Sugar (from an article)

东汉明帝驾崩，马皇后成了马太后，大臣疑心她要专权，太后就说，咱以后，含饴弄孙——含着麦芽糖逗逗孙子，这就能过日子了。罗马帝国时期，甜品单里大多是新鲜或干透的水果，以此取甜。  

用蔗糖最早的，应该是印度人。公元前三世纪，亚历山大东征，在印度发现有人嚼甘蔗取甜味，觉得有趣，便想法子移种。蔗糖提取不易，所以人类历史上大多数时候，砂糖的供应不顺畅。甜味曾经是个政治问题。跟英国人有关的糖危机，发生过两次。一次是19世纪初，英国人跟拿破仑打仗，拿破仑打不过英吉利海峡，便搞经济封锁，英国人一生气，也不给欧洲大陆供蔗糖。拿破仑御下的大陆诸国要哭了：一口甜的都吃不上！德国人这时跳出来：咱有甜菜，可以榨糖，让蔗糖去死吧！结果德国经济靠此崛起，实在是意料之外。另一次是20世纪初，《泰晤士报》连篇累牍，说只有下等阶级的人才爱吃甜喝甜，嗜糖如命。上流社会都要修身养性，减少食物含糖量还来不及呢。结果英国人对茶里放糖，依然故我。到二战时，人民需要营养和热量，支持抗击纳粹事业，实行配给制，糖不够用，怎么办？答：往茶里加牛奶，“多加些牛奶，茶就甜了。”

葡萄酒发酵，酒精度和糖分此消彼长，所以爱喝偏甜葡萄酒的，就会被资深好酒者小看。南欧惯例，像葡萄牙、西班牙和南法酿葡萄酒，都喜欢加酒精强化，提前终止发酵，导致葡萄酒甜浓醉人。但这种喝法，法国北部的人就不大喜欢。德国人喝啤酒，嫌麦酒太甜，加了啤酒花，得了其中的清爽苦味才过瘾，反过来还要嘲笑：波兰这群胖子，就是爱喝甜烧酒，个个都是大冬天长个酒糟鼻子！

如此，口味甜不甜，在欧洲像个阶级问题。

福塞尔(Paul Fussell, American cultural and literary historian, author and university professor)《格调(Class)》里认为，现代社会，下等人才会迷恋甜味。上流社会也因此摇旗鼓吹，认为懂得品茶与咖啡的苦味，才能谏果回甘，体会到深层的味道云云……大概可以这么说：上等人觉得，甜味经常显得女性化、脆弱、下等、世俗、不够高雅，能尝得苦味才显得品味非凡、耐得住寂寞等等，但抛去一切形而上的想象，我们普通人类本性的DNA里，还就是喜欢甜的东西。

> Hui: 《格调》是一本精确而刺痛人的社会等级指南。等级是什么？它不是你的职业，不是你居住的地方，不是你的餐桌举止，不是你有多少钱或者你能挣多少钱。**等级是一系列细微事物的组合**，你很难说清楚。正是这些细微的品质确立了你在这个世界上的位置。作者通过敏锐的观察、独特的视角、鞭辟入里的分析和机智幽默的文笔，把美国社会中的社会等级现象和三六九等人的品味做了细致入微的对比。 


## The European Coffeehouse Culture [咖啡馆里的欧洲文化，克劳士.提勒多曼]

- 根据一个有趣而且听起来可信的说法，咖啡不是由人，而是由动物发现的。大概在500年前，衣索比亚的牧羊人注意到他们的山羊吃了灌木丛中一种红色的莓子之后，突然兴奋的跳起来；牧羊人也好奇地尝尝这种看起来像樱桃的果子，结果也感受到类似的兴奋感。于是咖啡在世界各地的流传便开始了。

### What is big data

- Trend: Analyzing non-structured data

- Genernalized definition: 
    1. structured data
    2. non-structured data(text,voice,vedio,GPS,sensor)
    3. Data storage/processing/analyzing techniques: Hadoop, NoSQL, machine learning/satatistics
    4. Data Scientist/Data oriented organization

- Decide.com/FlightCaster

- Bottle neck of machine learning: store and process big data (doubt it)

* From point information to thread information 
     + Point information: purchase a product, received a service......
     + We need thread information to answer WHY!
     + Thread information: customer interaction data (non-structured or historical behavior)

     
### Walk Between Privacy and Innovation

- Collaborative Filtering (Amazon): method of making automative predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The **underline assumption** of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person **A** has the same opinion as a person **B** on an issue, **A** is more likely to have **B**'s opinion on a different issue **X** than to have the opinion on **X** of **a person chosen randomly**.

- Rapleaf: using email address/name to get personal profile (linked to information on Facebook)

### Data Aggregator

- Pay as You Drive: car insurance (provide discount according to the driving habit)
- For company with internal technique skill: collection, cleaning, analyzing, result delivery, implementation
- Data Aggregator: provide some hard to collect off-line data (what are those?)
- Who will be data aggregator: those who develop devices for data entry and collection
- More personal, more useful, harder to get
- Payment service companies (VISA, American Express etc.): on the road to data aggregator [VISA collabrate with GAP]
- Aggregate data
     + Internal Data + External Data-->Premiun Data (multiplication effect)
     + Example: Catalina Marketing and Nilson evaluate the TV ad by studying the association between audience rating and actual purchse
     + What data to get? 
     + Example: iphone App: Nike+GPS, get running route (anonymous) and use the information to get insight for store location

### Data Scientist

- Sexy
- Characters:
     + Communication skill
     + Entrepreneuership: explore how to make data useful, lead to new data based services
     + Curiosity: not limited in art, techniques, medicine, natural science......but keenly curious about different areas. By analyzing data from differnt fields, data scientist with curiosity will find bonanza

## [Nov2015]不畏将来不念过去

- 若想改变,就从丢弃旧物开始 你留存的记忆越多,就意味着未来可以伤你的越多。你留存的记忆越细致,越是容易铸造出一个思维的牢笼,困于其中 ,越陷越深。 

> Hui: 收藏旧物无关对错，是一种生活方式。我喜欢保留旧物，人是由记忆浇灌的，为什么记忆一定是伤人的？你会被记忆所伤，说明心灵还不够强大，还没有释怀，人生就是一场修行，路漫漫其修远兮。人生从来就不完美，回避隐藏并不能让你强大，面对真相、释怀才是最终的救赎，而后自道天凉好个秋。回避是因为在乎，刻意回避反而加深了刻痕，离释怀越远。

- 到了最后,就在那个愿意放下偏见和骄傲的时候,遇见一个同样愿意的人,在一段靠谱的感情中,走向一段靠谱的婚姻
。然后,所有的剧情都落幕了,剩下的事,该来到的都来到了。不是因为你更爱谁,就可以不用面对那些鸡毛蒜皮,只
是愿意和不愿意而已。
- 欲望和天真绝无法做伴。
- 有勇气在世俗与爱情中找到平衡的人,才能相信他可以将爱情进行到底。这是我们这个时代的爱情。
- 艳遇其实就是在不提前设想、不设防的情况下发生的美丽意外,是都市人久久不敢随心而动之后,对自己内心直觉灵感的一种释放。
- 预言的自我实现:以没有确凿证据的预言为契机,唤起一种新的行动,这种行动最终使 起初的预言变为现实
- 真正的专家首先要理解专家的基本条件,然后再去思考如何成为专家。
- 我再提出一个预言——“任何人都能够成为专家”。

## Living History Farms
**Foodways**: The Ioway made use of Iowa’s prairies, rivers and wooded valleys to find food. They hunted and fished for meat. They gathered wild plants. The Ioway farmed along the rivers. Many foods were eaten fresh, while others were dried and stored for the rest of the year. The Ioway ate fresh food in season. They ate some foods raw, but also cooked many foods at ta fire pit. Each family prepared their own daily meals. Iowa women preserved food by drying it. They cut fresh meat into thin slices and hung it to dry in the sun. Ears of corn were hung from poles or speed on platforms to dry on the vine and then shell them. Squash were sliced into thin rings and hung on frames to dry. The Ioway used dried foods to make stews, the main dish in their diet. Dried meat was also pulverized and mixed with berries and animal fat to make pemmican. Dried corn could be ground into flour for breads and thickeners.

**Storing Food**: The Ioway stored dried foods in cache pits, bell-shaped holes dug into the ground. The cache pit could be up to five feet deep. Women first lined the pit with bark or grass to keep put moisture and pests. The Ioway then added ears of corn along the outside, filling the center with ben and then squash. The opening was covered by layers of animal hide, grass, planks and ashes.

- 《有限与无限的游戏》把这个世界上的游戏类型分成两类：  
1.有限游戏——所有当事人同意结束，就结束了。这种游戏从属于人。小到围棋，大到战争，都是如此。  
2.无限游戏——人的存在只是为了维持游戏本身的延续。比如经济系统、人生荣耀。想伟大，就要把所有的有限游戏变成无限游戏。想快乐，就要把所有的无限游戏变成有限游戏。伟大且快乐者，在这二者之间来去自由。
- 人生来自由，却无往不在这场以有涯随无涯的博弈(all pay auction) 当中。出路有四：  
第一，不参加。  
第二，如果你一定要下注，就在目标价值以下随机下注，一次性下注，不追加下注。  
第三，如果你一定要参加多轮的全付费游戏，就得从主观上调整这个游戏对你的payoff，毕竟效用因人而异。  
第四，在不能赢的大游戏中刻画出有可能赢的小游戏。不必成为芭蕾舞明星，练练芭蕾舞，只为怡情行不行？  
一个建议对所有人都有用：不要以人生为赌注，不要把回报寄托在将来成为赢家；要让人生本身就是回报，当下就是回报，最好每一刻都是回报。当下就要快乐，最好始终都快乐。
- Uncertainty arises because of limitations in our ability to observe the world, limitations in our ability to model it, and possibly even because of innate nondeterminism.
- 一句很动人的情话：“迟早会有人举着戒指对你笑，说着余生请你多指教。”
- 如果私人领域一直无法理直气壮地言明权利边界，那么公共空间自然更加无处构建。所以，我们一直有意无意地被置于一种混沌之中。在这样的渊源之下，我们单独去强调私德、公德、教养和素质都是无效的。定义人和人之间的界限是尊重的基本条件。清楚的意识到我要的并非是你要的，己所不欲勿施于人，己所欲也并非能够随意强加于人。只有定义了边界，才能将他人作为一个独立的个体来尊重而不只是自我的延伸。
- 爱自己不是自私自利不懂宽容改变，会爱自己是指你可以完全按照自己的意愿生活，并且还能拥有别人的爱与呵护，不论单身还是已婚，这种女人的气场里总是带着温暖与惬意，更多的时候这也是一直自律和心境的比拼，赢得自己才能赢得人生。会爱自己的女人无论嫁给谁都会幸福，即便你谁也不嫁那幸福的姿态和模样也依旧会光芒万丈，你对爱自己这件事念念不忘，那么绽放和飘零就都是美。“慎独”二字也适用于对生活和情感有较高追求的女人，在没有旁人的时候也凭借高度的自觉，坚持做那个最美好也最精致的自己。不允许自己懒惰邋遢，不允许自己脆弱逃避，不允许自己没有期限的痛苦彷徨，住整洁的屋，睡温馨的床，穿干净的衣，读温暖的书，交有益的友，爱值得的人。就算这些你也需要时间努力拥有，那我也希望你的这个夜晚，会因为这些文字而展露出你最美丽的笑颜，从明天起定个短期计划先去做，能做多少做多少，唯独不要怨天尤人和自暴自弃。天生丽质的女子凤毛麟角，绝大多数的美人儿都是后天养出来的。终究不是岁月败美人，而是美人惊艳了时光。
- 在多少岁恋爱结婚不重要，重要的事和你共度余生的那个人是不是最正确的人，是值得你去珍惜并且相处起来很舒服的那个人，是你可以做真实的自己和最好的自己。好的爱情可以让人变得更好、共同成长，爱本就是两个人相互磨合的过程，如果不适合相处起来会很困难。遇不到那个人可以慢慢等，去提升自己，努力变得更优秀。要么不爱要么深爱，对自己的幸福负责，不随便牵手，不轻易承诺。遇不到真爱，是因为你活得还不够漂亮，出色的颜值包括外在的精致和内在的才华，只有当你的脸能够闪烁出迷人的气场，你心灵的丰盈才能让身边的人感受到力量，缺哪一样你都算不上活得漂亮。不要以为你变得冷漠就是你的成长，成熟的你应该变得温柔，对全世界都温柔。
- 已经失去的东西就不必再停留，成长就是一段又一段锥心的痛，不计后果的那一段叫青春，从此以后我们必须独自长大并且担负责任。过得好当下的人，是不需要忧虑未来的，当温柔已经成为了一种处事的能力，女人的才华才能尽显华彩。
- 丈夫到底是个什么东西？放在那里不打理就长荒草，天天擦一遍他又会跑，一进家就打蔫出了门来精神，在你面前浪漫风情全不懂，在别人眼里却是情圣一大个。其实没什么好不懂的，丈夫，一丈之内是你夫，一丈之外是个男人，还担当着很多的社会角色，他们需要有更广阔的天地驰骋，以便更有能力来善待家人。这个社会有钱不是万能的，没钱也是万万不能的，“能力”这个词也已不能简单的用一声“我爱你”来诠释了，成为了丈夫后,他们还需要有让妻子和孩子享受基本幸福的本领，有时候丈夫们也没什么错。如果连这一点担当与责任心都没有的话，是不配升级做丈夫的。丈夫这东西，其实就是愿意为你一个人守候的那个男人，初衷都是好的，你要相信这一点，过程都是不容易的，你要理解这一点。
- 一半算是自嘲，一半算是抖落一下世俗生活的尘土——做雅痞这件事儿，其实的确还是挺辛苦的。
- 话糙理不糙，人生如妓，努力达到角色与体验的高度统一，才是正道。
- 不要评价一个人的出身，因为这无法改变；**不要评价一个人的遭遇，因为你不知道他的故事**。**不要评价一个人的感情，除非你参与了他的人生**。与其关注一个人的未来，不如是踏踏实实做好自己。
- 《西西里的美丽传说》里，莫妮卡·贝鲁奇的丈夫死在了战场，而她作为一个美艳的寡妇，失去了男人的保护，也没有任何经济来源，她于是只有通过出卖身体换面包吃。在那个战争年代，人都是很矛盾的——男人都想得到她，却纷纷假装厌弃她；女人都想成为她，却都想扑上去摧毁她，在背后毁灭她。其实她没有什么过错，她最大的过错就是生的太过美丽。
- “大家一定要小心那些有六块腹肌的男人和永远保持好身材的女人，这些人拥有你所想不到的决心和意志力。想一想大白天里，他们能“唰”的一下从床上爬起来，到外面跑上几圈。多可怕啊！他们什么事都能干得出来。这绝对不是一个笑话，但凡是有一副好身材的人，活得都不会太差。”
- 变态的工作关系也是应该避免的，你们要特别避免在你们不崇敬或者不想像他一样的人手下干活，那是很危险的。所有人在某种程度上都受到权威人物的控制，尤其是那些为我们提供回报的权威人物。在我年轻的时候，我的办法是找出我尊敬的人，然后想办法调到他手下去。在你们正确地仰慕的人手下工作，在生活中取得的成就将会更加令人满意。
- 在遭遇一件令你难以接受的悲剧时，你永远也不能因为摆脱不掉它的困扰、在生活中再屡遭失败而让这一件悲剧变成两件、三件。
- 复杂的官僚程序不是文明社会的最好制度。更好的制度是一张无缝的、非官僚的信任之网。
- 如果你的思维完全依赖于他人，只要一超出你的领域，就求助专家建议，那么你将遭受很多灾难。
- 技术从来不是人性的反面。  
技术只是人类机体的延伸。  
技术是人性最充分的显现。  
技术如果出问题，是人性本身出问题。
- 《死时谁为你哭泣》的作者罗宾·夏玛说：“不是因为某件事很难，你才不想做，而是因为你不想做，让这件事变得很难。”
- 有民主就不会有财富上的平均分配，平均按需分配是社会主义国家假想的现象。民主意味着一种精神上的平等，决定权上的平等，但在此基础上，人便会自动在财富的分配上区别开来，除非认为强制分配，否则无法平均，因为人的能力，品格和运气各不相同。
- 找到适合自己的工作与生活的平衡方式。人要取得平衡，不在于每天花多长时间工作、又能余下多长时间过自己的生活，而是在于你的选择：在于选择要什么、选择做什么、选择如何有质量的去做到，也在于你是否能寻求到内心的那份安宁与坦然。
- 培养并尊重内心的直觉。是的，在战术层面上，数据非常有用，但是，在战略层面，一个卓越的市场人的直觉同样可贵。因为他们的直觉能让公司看到数据看不到的东西——那些深藏在消费者心里的东西。例如：品牌的定位（是应该聚焦在一个诉求还是更多），品牌/产品的命名，一个品类到底需要多少个品牌才能获取最大市场份额等等。
- 爱情就是两个人一起犯贱，突然一个人不犯了，另一个就SB了。
- 说走就走是人生最华美的奢侈，也是最灿烂的自由。
- If you don't understand my silence, you will never understand my words.
- 人生自古谁无死，贱人先死我后死。
- 幸福如人饮水，冷暖自知。你不是别人，怎知那人走过的路，心中的乐与苦。
- 时间不知不觉，我们后知后觉。
