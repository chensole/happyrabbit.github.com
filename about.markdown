## About me ##

I am a [statistician](http://hui1987.com) who takes calculated risk and embraces the uncertainty from God. 

I am a vegan. I like cooking (I consider myself as a good cook but the problem is that I am the only one think so. The best comment I got from Mom for my cook is “just eatable”), drawing/painting, flute, piano, running and yoga. I love traveling and joke/joking : ). I am addicted to [analyzing data](http://hui1987.com) and reading.
