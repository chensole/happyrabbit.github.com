<li>The best way to predict future is to create it. But it is the thing only God can do.</li>

<li>We see what we want to see which is why we are stupid.</li>

<li>Nobody likes those who are smarter.</li>

<li>Whenever a company doesn't perform well, CEO always talks about the tough economic environment. 
It is like Chinese leader always blame foreign separatist forces intrigue riots in China. 
Being tactical is the exact way leaders need to be. Is there anything new under the sun?</li>

<li>Whenever US is boasting about her democracy and pushing others to follow the same way, I hear one 
sinner talks to another sinner : "I am less sinful because I only had a small bite of the evil apple but you had a big bite." </li>
