> Organised common (or uncommon) sense – very basic knowledge is an enormously powerful tool... You have to have a temperament to grab ideas and do sensible things. [Charlie Munger]

> I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library. [Jorge Luis Borges]

> Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes  [Peter F. Drucker]

### What is PKM?

Here is what I got from  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management):

> Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a collection of processes that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve, and share knowledge in his or her daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities. [Wikipedia]

But I have my version of definition:

> Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a collection of processes that a person manages information, extracts and refines knowledge, share with others, uses knowledge to do sensible things and breaks boundaries between disciplines. [Hui]

### Why PKM?

It takes me very long time to realize I badly need PKM. I love books (learning) which has been the case since I can remember. However, I was not on purposely selective about what I read. As a random reader, I went to a bookstore, randomly picked book and read whatever seemed to interest me at that time.  Or sometimes my friends recommended book to me. It actually has been my attitude towards many other things: choose from whatever come to me that seemed interest me instead of **knowing what I really want and go to get it**. Unfortunately, I am happened to be the kind of person who is interested in a million things under the sun. It is not hard to imagine how I got myself in trouble…A friend and I founded a statistical consulting company in Apr 2012 that provides statistical training and consulting in Beijing. Both of us quitted one year later. We quitted at the same time but for different reasons. I was extremely passionated  at that time but not happy at all. I became a stranger even to myself, someone not loving. (Later I read about [focusing illusion](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11984) which may explain my change at that time. ) I learnt a lot from the experience. Here I just want to mention three learnings that are related to PKM:

1. There are big gaps along the process:  

    > Information—>Knowledge—> Skill
    
1. I have to change gear to be selective:  figure out what I want then go to get it
1. I need put effort on building **Mental Framework**

What is mental framework? It is what Charlie Munger calls Latticework of Mental Models:

> <span style="color:blue">You have to learn all the big ideas in the key disciplines in a way that they’re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use them for the rest of your life. If you do that, I solemnly promise you that one day you’ll be walking down the street and you’ll look to your right and left and you’ll think "my heavenly days, I’m now one of the few competent people in my whole age cohort." If you don’t do it, many of the brightest of you will live in the middle ranks or in the shallows. [Charlie Munger]</span>

Reading itself is not enough: you have to be able to grab key ideas and make sense of them. In order to found a sound framework: 

You have to learn different disciplines (as many as you can)
Put effort on extracting the most important and basic concepts in every discipline and start to learn pattern 

Once you have a framework, you can do something we call [触类旁通](http://dictionary.pinpinchinese.com/definitions/t/觸類旁通-chuleipangtong) in Chinese. Personal Knowledge Management, in my opinion, is a way to build Mental Framework. It aims at: 

1. Learn a set of strong, useful concepts from each discipline and tie them together in such a way that **the whole is greater than the sum of the parts**. 
1. Know the edge of our competency, know that there is much larger part of the world we don’t know
1. Be able to tell what we can do, what we can’t; what is important, what is not. And do the important things that we can do.

### How PKM?

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) need time to develop and I told myself to be patient. Here is my PKM MindMap (yours can be different):
