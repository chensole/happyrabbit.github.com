Let us begin our discussion from the first chapter of Chung-yung.
 <blockquote>
[1] What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature.  [2] To Follow human nature is called the Way. [3] Cultivating the Way is called teaching. [4] The Way cannot be separated from us for a moment. [5] What can be separated from us is not the Way. [6] Therefore the profound person is cautious over what he does not see and apprehensive over what he does not hear. [7] There is nothing more visible than what is hidden and nothing more manifest than what is subtle. [8] Therefore the profound person is watchful over himself when he is alone. [9] Before the feelings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy are aroused it is called centrality. [10] When the feelings are aroused and each and all attain due measure and degree, it is called harmony. [11] Centrality is the great foundation of the world, and harmony is its universal path. [12] To cultivate centrality and harmony with thoroughness is the way  to bring heaven and earth to their proper place and all things their proper nourishment.
