## What is PKM?

It is better to ask [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). Here is what I got:

> Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a collection of processes that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve, and share knowledge in his or her daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities. It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers increasingly need to be responsible for their own growth and learning. [Wikipedia]


Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) need time to develop and I told myself to be patient. It talks me very long time to realize I badly need PKM. I love books which has been the case since I can remember. However, I was not on purposely selective about what I read. Being a random reader, I went to a bookstore, randomly picked book and read whatever seemed to interest me at that time.  Or sometimes my friends recommended book to me. It seems to be the attitude towards many other things: choose from whatever come to me that seemed interest me instead of **knowing what I want and go to get it**.
