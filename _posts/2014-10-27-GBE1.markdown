Globalization has been a buzz word like “big data”. You have heard about it a thousand times but you feel difficult to define what it is and what exact role it plays. That is the reason I took Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/globalbusiness">
Global Business Environment 1 </a>. There are no slides for this course. I am taking a stab at sorting out what have been discussed during the first part of this course and may add in some of my ideas. It helps me mull over the topic and deepen my understanding. 

**What is Globalization?**

**Is Globalization New?**

**How do Political and Social Institutions impact National Economic Development?**

**What is the role of Culture?**

**What are the Gains from Trade?**

**Free Trade, Free-r Trade or Managed Trade?**

**What are Foreign Currencies and how are Exchange Rates Determined?**

**What does the Current Global Business Environment look like?**
