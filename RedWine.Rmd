![](http://linhui.org/images/Wine/LePrinceDeCourthezonCotesDuRhone2013.jpeg)

- Made by Thierry Ferlay in a village cellar specializing in Châteauneuf-du-Pape as well as Côtes-du-Rhône.
     
     > Châteauneuf-du-Pape is a French wine Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) located around the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the Rhône wine region in southeastern France. It is one of the most renowned appellations of the southern part of the Rhône Valley. [沙托纳迪帕普（法语：Châteauneuf-du-Pape）是法国普罗旺斯-阿尔卑斯-蓝色海岸大区 沃克吕兹省的一个市镇，属于阿维尼翁区 奥朗热西县。该市镇2009年时的人口 为2130人。 法语"Châteauneuf-du-Pape"意思实为“教皇新堡”，故而亦有此译名。]
     
- The same mix of grapes – juicy, ripe **Grenache** backed up by spicy Syrah and full-bodied Mourvédre. It’s a formula that gives his Côtes-du-Rhône waves of rich, yet elegant character.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
